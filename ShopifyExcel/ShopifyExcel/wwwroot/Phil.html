                <p>
                    Shopping for fragrance can be confusing at best, or overwhelming at worst. Not only are there top notes, middle notes,
                    and bottom notes, but whole classes of scents. What’s more, once you’ve decided on a scent, another decision must be made:
                    perfume, eau de parfum, eau de toilette or cologne?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fragrances are available in perfume, eau de parfum, eau de toilette, or cologne form. The main differentiating factor of these
                    is the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent – that is, how much fragrance is in the formula’s composition. The more
                    actual perfume concentrate it contains, the longer the scent will last on your skin, and the more expensive the product. Following
                    is a breakdown of these categories.

                <font size="5"><b>Perfume</b></font>
                <p>
                    Perfume, also referred to as perfume extract, is the most concentrated formulation, and is usually the most expensive. It contains
                    15-30% aromatic compounds. Due to its high amount of aromatic compounds, it also tends to last the longest when applied to the skin.
                    It is usually sold in small bottles of 1 ounce or less.
                </p>

                <font size="5"><b>Eau de Parfum</b></font>
                <p>
                    Eau de parfum, also called eau de perfume, is the next most concentrated formula, and one of the most popular purchases. It
                    consists of 10-15% aromatic compounds.
                </p>

            <font size="5">
                <font size="8"><b>Eau de Toilette</b></font>
                <p>
                    Eau de toilette is also a popular choice, and is less expensive than the perfume or parfum formulations, although its scent will
                    not last as long when applied to the skin. Eau de toilette contains 5-20% aromatic compounds.
                </p>

            <font size="5">
                <font size="5"><b>Cologne, or Eau de Cologne</b></font>
                <p>
                    Eau de Cologne originated in Cologne, Germany. Today, it is a generic term that defines a class of scented formulations by its
                    typical concentration of about 2-5%. Cologne products are available for either men or women, and are sometimes mistaken for aftershave,
                    which is actually a formula containing moisturizer, an antiseptic agent, and perfume. In addition, aftershave can be a gel, lotion, or liquid.
                </p>

            <font size="5">
                <font size="5"><b>Tester</b></font>
                <p>
                    Testers are even more discounted than the fancy boxed versions and are great if you don't have a need for the fancy box. Testers are 100%
                    authentic, fresh and completely full just like the original fragrance, however they are meant for the counter in a department store. Testers
                    often come in a plain white box but sometimes they do not have a cap or a box. The savings on the packaging means you save even more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any perfume concentration, be sure to keep the bottle tightly sealed and stored in a cool, dry place away from windows or direct sunlight
                    or heat sources to maximize its shelf life. For best results, store opened bottles inside their boxes. Fragrances usually last three years
                    from the date they were manufactured.

                <font size="5"><b>What is the difference between a splash and a spray?</b></font>
                <p>
                    There is absolutely no difference in the fragrance. The difference is in the method of application only. However, a spray bottle, being sealed
                    all the time, may actually have a longer shelf life. Making the decision between spray and splash is entirely a matter of personal preference.
